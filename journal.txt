Trying to fit interstitial calcite dissolution obsered in SAE1. Pest++ wants SA_VF power to be ~15. I don't think this is reasonable.

Looks like value for Calc_is_SA_VF can't be set below 1 or it shits the bed. However it's happy to fit any value 1 or above reasonably well. Unclear exactly why this would be from reading the pflotran documentation. A/A0 = (phi/phi0)^n, where n=2/3 would be a sphere. But we apparently need A to decrease faster than that?

calc_is_SA_VF (fixed)	calc_is_sa	calc_is_vf
1	0.0400807	0.000548512
2	0.0636064	0.000711128
5	0.105053	0.00122044

All of these combinations do a decent job at reproducing the data. SA_VF = 1 is basically a straight line in Ca and pH outputs, and higher numbers show more of an exponential decay, which is probably a better fit to the data.

Running fits to all 4 experiments currently hangs while running SAE2 for some reason. pflotran fails for sae2 earlier in the run too.

Maybe I can try to hone in on the calcite surface parameters by fitting those and Ca++ and pH first, before trying SiO2?

Fit some Calc parameters:

  Calc_alpha:          1.8387       # default value when parameter is inactive
  Calc_SA:             2.71572      # default value when parameter is inactive
  Calc_SA_VF:          3.57794      # default value when parameter is inactive
  Calc_is_alpha:       1            # default value when parameter is inactive
  Calc_is_SA:          0.0857075    # default value when parameter is inactive
  Calc_is_SA_VF:       2            # default value when parameter is inactive
  Calc_is_VF:          0.000744927  # default value when parameter is inactive
  
Now trying to fit SiO2 parameters independently (fitting only to SiO2 abundances)

Some apparent strange behaviour in pestpp where certain parameters aren't adjusted at all from their initial values?

Current confusion is how the different derinc types and transformations affect parameters such as SA_VF which can be around or close to zero.

"absolute" vs "relative" increment type for parameter groups, and how that interacts with parameter transformation and change limiters...
